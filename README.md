# Coffee Sales Excel Project

### Project Overview


This is an Excel dashboard I built to analyze coffee sales data across different countries, customers, and time periods. The goal was to practice cleaning data from multiple sheets, connecting them using lookup formulas, and visualizing business performance with PivotTables, slicers, and charts.






### Data Sources
- `Coffee Sales Project.xlsx` â€“ contains three sheets: `Orders`, `Customers`, and `Products`, used to create the dashboard.
- Note: This is a fictional dataset created for learning and practice purposes.
 

### Tools

- Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visuialization, and Reporting

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

- Cleaned data by removing duplicates and checking for missing values
- Standardized column names and added a new column for detailed coffee type names
- Converted raw data into Excel Tables for easier filtering and referencing
- Linked the `Orders`, `Customers`, and `Products` sheets using:
  - `XLOOKUP` for customer and product info
  - `INDEX-MATCH` for alternative lookups and deeper practice








### Exploratory Data Analysis
- What are the total coffee sales over time?
- Who are our top 5 customers?
- How do sales break down by country?
- Which products are driving revenue?


### Data Analysis


Used Excel PivotTables and formulas to analyze key metrics:

- **Sales Over Time** â€“ Line chart with a timeline slicer
- **Top 5 Customers** â€“ Bar chart of highest revenue customers
- **Sales by Country** â€“ Bar chart comparing total sales per region
- **Slicers** â€“ Added interactive slicers for Product Type, Country, and Customer

#### Example Formulas Used:
- `=XLOOKUP(C2,customers!$A$1:$A$1001,customers!$G$1:$G$1001,,0)`
- `=INDEX(products!$A$1:$G$49,MATCH(orders!$D2,products!$A$1:$A$49,0),MATCH(orders!J$1,products!$A$1:$G$1,0))`
